f you want to test your API before using it in a client application, you can invoke your REST services straight from a browser address bar. For example, you could try:

http://localhost:3000/wines
You will only be able to test your GET services that way. A more versatile solution to test RESTful services is to use cURL, 
a command line utility for transferring data with URL syntax.

For example, using cURL, you can test the Wine Cellar API with the following commands:

Get all wines:
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3000/wines

Get wine with _id value of 5069b47aa892630aae000007 (use a value that exists in your database):
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3000/wines/5069b47aa892630aae000007

Delete wine with _id value of 5069b47aa892630aae000007:
curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/wines/5069b47aa892630aae000007

Add a new wine:
curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "New Wine", "year": "2009"}' http://localhost:3000/wines

Modify wine with _id value of 5069b47aa892630aae000007:
curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "New Wine", "year": "2010"}' http://localhost:3000/wines/5069b47aa892630aae000007
